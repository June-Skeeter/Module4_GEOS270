# Content Questions

### QC1

The [Clip/Intersect/Union] tool can be used to identify the areas of two or more [vector/raster] layers that overlap *and* combine all attributes to create a new layer.

### QC2

The [Clip/Intersect/Union] tool can be used to combine all attributes of two or more [vector/raster] layers and create a new layer.  This tool will include non-overlapping area in the output.


### QC3

The [Clip/Intersect/Union] tool can be used like a cookie cutter.  It cuts away the portions of an input that do not overlap the clip layer but does not merge attributes.

### QC4

The [Weighted Overlay/Slope/Union/Zonal Statistics] tool can be used to conduct suitability or risk analysis.  Multiple [raster/vector] layers are overlaid to generate a suitability or risk classification map.

### QC5

The [Raster Calculator/Weighted Overlay/Union/Zonal Statistics] tool can also be used to conduct suitability or risk analysis, but it is a more general tool that allows you to define algebraic expressions using raster layers.

### QC6

The [Slope/Aspect/Reclassify] tool can also be used to calculate the compass direction that a hillside is facing.

### QC7

Stratified random sampling is a(n) [biased/unbiased] sampling method that seeks to draw a more representative sample than pure random sampling.

### QC8

Spatial [autocorrelation/interpolation/overlay] effects the results we get when sampling spatial data. It is important to think through the impacts when we are sampling spatial data.

### QC9

Spatial [Interpolation/Overlay/Sampling] is a process used to "read between the lines" or infer what values are between locations where we have measurements.

### QC10

Our guest speaker Alysha is the ______ for Peace Geeks, a non-profit that builds digital tools that provide refugees and immigrants crucial knowledge to take charge of their migration journeys.  Peace Geeks developed an app called ______ to help newcomers to British Columbia and Manitoba find information and connect with free services.
