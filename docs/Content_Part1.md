# Spatial Analysis Methods

This portion of the module will cover assorted techniques/tools we use to analyze spatial data layers.

* We need different tools for vector data and raster data.
	* Vector data structures are more complex, so there are a number of different ways to see how features relate to each other.
	* Raster data is less complex, but there are many different types of analysis we can conduct with it!
